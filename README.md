### This crate provides non-panicking versions of:
- std::print!()
- std::println!()
- std::eprint!()
- std::eprintln!()

> Print! can panic???

Astonishingly, yes: [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24821).

It's very rare, you might never see it, you can also guarantee that you won't see it by using this crate.

# Usage

## Step 1 - Dependency
Add `comfy-print` as a dependency to your project.

## Step 2 - Replace macro invocations
- Replace every invocation of `std::print!()`    with `comfy_print::print!`
- Replace every invocation of `std::println!()`  with `comfy_print::println!`
- Replace every invocation of `std::eprint!()`   with `comfy_print::eprint!`
- Replace every invocation of `std::eprintln!()` with `comfy_print::eprintln!`

If you're familiar with Regex, you can use the "Replace in files" command of your IDE to do it all at once. 

The default shortcut is often `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + Shift + H`.

Here's the patterns that I use (with Jetbrains Intellij IDEs, Java's Regex):
- Match: `(?<!comfy_e?)(?<type>print!|println!|eprint!|eprintln!)`
- Replace: `comfy_print::comfy_${type}`

## Step 3 - Get comfortable

## Step 4 - Actually, you can also configure the behavior of this crate through global variables, check the config module for more info.

---

# Pros

- No unsafe code.
- Still thread-safe.
- To avoid deadlocks, locks on std(out/err) are acquired/released in quick succession.
- You may still freely use the std::print! macros, they do not conflict with any of the comfy_print macros.
- Resilient:
    - The provided macros won't simply "silently fail" when writing to std(out/err) returns an error. Instead, this crate keeps the requested prints in a thread-safe queue, then tries to print again later.
    - The queue ensures prints will always be delivered in the order they were requested.

---

# Cons
- Worse performance:
    - Some very basic synthetic benchmarks showed that, on average, this version has similar performance to std::print!. 
    - This version has higher performance variance compared to std::print!.

# Code logic

Data type for storing prints:

<details>
  <summary>File: utils.rs</summary>
  
```rs
use std::fmt::{Display, Formatter};

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub enum OutputKind {
    Stdout,
    Stderr,
}

pub struct Message {
    string: String,
    output: OutputKind,
}

impl Message {
    pub fn str(&self) -> &str {
        return self.string.as_str();
    }
    
    pub fn output_kind(&self) -> OutputKind {
        return self.output;
    }
    
    pub fn standard(string: String) -> Self {
        return Self {
            string,
            output: OutputKind::Stdout,
        };
    }
    
    pub fn error(string: String) -> Self {
        return Self {
            string,
            output: OutputKind::Stderr,
        };
    }
}

impl Display for Message {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        return write!(f, "{}", self.string);
    }
}

pub fn try_write(msg_str: &impl Display, output_kind: OutputKind) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    match output_kind {
        OutputKind::Stdout => {
            let mut stdout = std::io::stdout().lock();
            write!(stdout, "{}", msg_str)?;
            stdout.flush()?;
            Ok(())
        }
        OutputKind::Stderr => {
            let mut stderr = std::io::stderr().lock();
            write!(stderr, "{}", msg_str)?;
            stderr.flush()?;
            Ok(())
        }
    }
}

```
</details>

A simple struct `Message` that contains the `string` to print and where it should be printed `std(out/err)`:
- `get()` functions to access the private fields, and a 
- A constructor for each print target.
- To facilitate formatting, I implemented the trait `Display` for `Message`.

There's also `pub fn try_write(msg_str: &impl Display, output_kind: OutputKind)`, it attempts to print the messages to the desired outputs, returning errors if anything fails.

---

These macros serve as bridges to our actual code, just like `std::prints` do:

<details>
  <summary>In file: async_impl.rs</summary>
  
```rs
pub fn _print(input: String) {
    _comfy_print_async(Message::standard(input));
}

pub fn _println(mut input: String) {
    input.push('\n');
    _comfy_print_async(Message::standard(input));
}

pub fn _eprint(input: String) {
    _comfy_print_async(Message::error(input));
}

pub fn _eprintln(mut input: String) {
    input.push('\n');
    _comfy_print_async(Message::error(input));
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! comfy_print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::async_impl::_print(std::format!($($arg)*));
    }};
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! comfy_println {
    () => {
        $crate::async_impl::_println("\n")
    };
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::async_impl::_println(std::format!($($arg)*));
    }};
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! comfy_eprint {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::async_impl::_eprint(std::format!($($arg)*));
    }};
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! comfy_eprintln {
    () => {
        $crate::async_impl::_eprintln("\n")
    };
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::async_impl::_eprintln(std::format!($($arg)*));
    }};
}
```
</details>

Collection type for storing the queued prints:

```rs
use parking_lot::FairMutex;
static QUEUE: FairMutex<Vec<Message>> = FairMutex::new(Vec::new());
```

The queue is represented by a regular `Vec<Message>` wrapped in [parking_lot](https://crates.io/crates/parking_lot)'s `FairMutex`.

A regular `Mutex`, upon being unlocked, will give the lock to the thread that is executed afterward, regardless of which thread requested the lock first. This type of lock is problematic for our use case, we want to ensure that prints are done in the exact order they were requested. If there are multiple threads waiting for the lock, the regular `Mutex` won't care about which one asked first, which may result in prints being enqueued on the wrong order.

On the other hand, a `FairMutex` makes threads form a queue upon requesting the lock, ensuring that the thread that asked first gets its turn first.

---

Before trying to print, we need to check if there are already other prints in the queue. If there are, we can't print `msg` right away because that would break the ordering of "prints requested -> prints delivered".

Prints will join the queue if they fail to write to their target output.

In the end, all 4 macros end up calling `comfy_print::async_impl::_comfy_print_async(msg)`:

<details>
    <summary>pub fn _comfy_print_async(msg: Message)</summary>

```rs
pub fn _comfy_print_async(msg: Message) {
    let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
    
    if queue_guard.len() == 0 {
        drop(queue_guard);
        write_first_in_line(msg);
    } else {
        queue_guard.push(msg);
        drop(queue_guard);
        check_thread();
    }
}
```

We lock the queue and check if it's empty.

</details>

---

<details>
    <summary>When QUEUE is empty</summary>

```rs
if queue_guard.len() == 0 {
    drop(queue_guard);
    write_first_in_line(msg);
}
```
We don't have to wait for other threads, just try to print right away. This is what happens in most cases.
  
Since we don't need the queue anymore, we immediately release it. Never owning two locks at the same time help avoiding some deadlocking cases.

<details>
    <summary>fn write_first_in_line(msg: Message)</summary>

```rs
fn write_first_in_line(msg: Message) {
    let msg_str: &str = msg.str();
    
    if let Err(err) = utils::try_write(&msg_str, msg.output_kind()) {
        let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
        queue_guard.insert(0, Message::error(format!(
            "comfy_print::blocking_write_first_in_line(): Failed to print first message in queue, it was pushed to the front again.\n\
            Error: {err}\n\
            Message: {msg_str}")));
        
        queue_guard.insert(1, msg);
    }
}
```

Here we try to write to the desired output. If that fails, we insert an error message in front of the queue, then the original message afterward.

Trying again is unlikely to yield any results, so we shouldn't do anything else.

We'll try again next time `comfy_print!` is called.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>When Queue has elements</summary>

```rs
} else {
    queue_guard.push(msg);
    drop(queue_guard);
    check_thread();
}
```

We join the queue, then check if there is already a thread printing it. 
  
If there isn't, we'll take that responsibility on this same thread.

```rs
static ACTIVE_THREAD: FairMutex<Option<JoinHandle<()>>> = FairMutex::new(None);
```

We keep track of the responsible thread using the `ACTIVE_THREAD` handle.

<details>
    <summary>fn check_thread()</summary>

```rs
fn check_thread() {
    let Some(mut thread_guard) = ACTIVE_THREAD.try_lock()
        else { return; };
    
    let is_printing = thread_guard.as_ref().is_some_and(|handle| !handle.is_finished());
    if is_printing { // We already pushed our msg to the queue and there's already a thread printing it, so we can return.
        return;
    }
    
    match thread::Builder::new().spawn(print_until_empty) {
        Ok(ok) => {
            *thread_guard = Some(ok);
            drop(thread_guard);
        },
        Err(err) => { // We couldn't create a thread, we'll have to block this one
            drop(thread_guard);
            
            let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
            queue_guard.insert(0, Message::error(format!(
                "comfy_print::queue_then_check_thread(): Failed to create a thread to print the queue.\n\
                Error: {err}.")));
            
            drop(queue_guard);
            print_until_empty();
        }
    }
}
```

There's a lot going on here so let's divide into smaller steps:

```rs
let Some(mut thread_guard) = ACTIVE_THREAD.try_lock()
    else { return; };

let is_printing = thread_guard.as_ref().is_some_and(|handle| !handle.is_finished());
if is_printing { // We already pushed our msg to the queue and there's already a thread printing it, so we can return.
    return;
}
```

First, by trying to acquire the lock, we perform a non-blocking operation that tells us if there's another thread already using it. If that's the case, we can assume that the other thread is also about to start printing the queue. We can stop here.

If we did acquire the lock, we can check if there's anything there, and if the handle inside belongs to a thread that's already finished.

If the handle exists and it's not finished, then it means the other thread is actively printing the queue, so we can return.

```rs
match thread::Builder::new().spawn(print_until_empty) {
```

Here we try spawning a new thread, requesting that it executes the function `fn print_until_empty()`. 

```rs
Ok(handle) => {
    *thread_guard = Some(handle);
    drop(thread_guard);
},
```

If spawning succeeds, we insert the handle in our static Mutex, other threads will check it to see if they can take the responsibility of printing.

As usual, we also immediately release the lock that we are holding.

```rs
Err(err) => {
    drop(thread_guard);
    
    let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
    queue_guard.insert(0, Message::error(format!(
        "comfy_print::queue_then_check_thread(): Failed to create a thread to print the queue.\n\
        Error: {err}.")));
    
    drop(queue_guard);
}
```

If, for whatever reason, spawning the thread fails, we have a new error message to print.

Once again, before acquiring a lock on the queue, we release the lock referencing the handle, then insert the error message in front of the queue.

We return now and hope that the user calls print again, which would read the queue and attempt to print all the stored messages.

```rs
fn print_until_empty() {
    const MAX_RETRIES: u8 = 50;
    let mut retries = 0;
    
    loop {
        let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
        
        if queue_guard.len() <= 0 {
            drop(queue_guard);
            break;
        }
        
        let msg = queue_guard.remove(0);
        let msg_str: &str = msg.str();
        let output_kind = msg.output_kind();
        drop(queue_guard); // unlock the queue before blocking stdout/err

        let write_result = utils::try_write(&msg_str, output_kind);
        
        if let Err(err) = write_result {
            let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
            queue_guard.insert(0, Message::error(format!(
                "comfy_print::write_until_empty(): Failed to print first message in queue.\n\
                Error: {err}\n\
                Message: {msg_str}\n\
                Target output: {output_kind:?}")));
            
            queue_guard.insert(1, msg);
            drop(queue_guard);
            
            retries += 1;
            if retries >= MAX_RETRIES {
                break;
            }
        }

        thread::yield_now();
    }
}
```

This is the function that actually prints the queue, let's break it into smaller steps.

```rs
const MAX_RETRIES: u8 = 50;
let mut retries = 0;
```

For starters, we have an arbitrary integer that defines the maximum number of retries in case a print operation fails, and the local integer `retries` to count the attempts.

```rs
let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();

if queue_guard.len() <= 0 {
    drop(queue_guard);
    break;
}
```

Inside the loop, we lock the queue, then stop if it's empty, as that would mean our job is done.

```rs
let msg = queue_guard.remove(0);
let msg_str: &str = msg.str();
let output_kind = msg.output_kind();
drop(queue_guard); // unlock the queue before blocking stdout/err
```

We pop the front element out of the queue, then immediately release the lock.

Releasing the lock here also ensures we don't hold two locks at once, as we are about to lock the output stream.

```rs
let write_result = utils::try_write(&msg_str, output_kind);

if let Err(err) = write_result {
    let mut queue_guard = QUEUE.lock();
    queue_guard.insert(0, Message::error(format!(
        "comfy_print::write_until_empty(): Failed to print first message in queue.\n\
        Error: {err}\n\
        Message: {msg_str}\n\
        Target output: {output_kind:?}")));
    
    queue_guard.insert(1, msg);
    drop(queue_guard);
    
    retries += 1;
    if retries >= MAX_RETRIES {
        break;
    }
}

thread::yield_now();
```

If writing to output fails, we'll insert an error message in front of the queue, then the original message afterward.

However, since we are guaranteed to not be in the main thread, we can hold the print responsibility for a bit longer, we'll keep trying to print up to `MAX_RETRIES`.

Regardless of the print result, at the end of each iteration we call `thread::yield_now();` this will give other threads a chance to hopefully un-screw the output stream, while also allowing more messages to join the queue.

## QA

> Why explicitly call `drop(guard)` on instances where it would automatically be called implicitly in the same order?

A: To take care of my future self: by leaving it implicit, I'm counting on my future brain to read the code and figure out the exact order of guards being locked/unlocked.

By explicitly writing `drop(guard)`, I'm making it clear where locks are released, thus my future brain will have fewer opportunities to make mistakes.

This also makes it clear for other programmers reading the code, they will have an easier time understanding my intentions.

---

> This is over-engineered

A: Yes, I wrote this crate with the intent of learning/practicing threads/concurrency in Rust. 

I also really hate the idea of seeing a `print!` call panic.
